Lightweight scripts for lab data processing, automation, and AI-ready formatting

This repository collects small Python tools Iâ€™ve developed to simplify and standardize data handling in my experimental research at Paul-Drude-Institute for Solid State Electronics(PDI) in Berlin.  

Each tool was built to solve practical problems, from automatically converting instrument outputs to organizing data in structured, machine-readable formats.

These scripts help make lab workflows more efficient and ready for AI-assisted analysis or integration with FAIR data platforms, such as FAIRmat and NOMAD.
